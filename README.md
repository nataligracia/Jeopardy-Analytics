## :bookmark_tabs: Limiations
Due to time limitations, we were unable to further study how different embedding models impact our BERTopic. We also were hoping to explore building a semi-supervised model using a smaller dataset where we manually classified topics.

It was also difficult to find pre-vetted Jeopardy datasets that provide more information around contestant earnings overtime.
